## 🧬 What is Brain Cancer?

Brain cancer refers to the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the brain. These tumors can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous), but both types can be life-threatening due to the limited space within the skull.

### 📊 Key Statistics:
- Brain tumors account for **~2% of all cancers** globally.
- **More than 300,000 new cases** are diagnosed worldwide each year.
- Early diagnosis significantly increases treatment success and survival rates.

### ⚠️ Causes & Effects:
- **Causes:** Genetic mutations, exposure to radiation, family history, immune system disorders.
- **Effects:** Seizures, cognitive impairments, headaches, speech/vision loss, and in severe cases, death.

## 🧪 Project Overview

This project combines **Multimodal Deep Learning**, **Transfer Learning**, and **Model Ensembling** to create a robust system for early brain cancer detection, deploying it for real-time usage.

---

## 🧠 What is Multimodal Deep Learning?

Multimodal Deep Learning integrates information from multiple data types for better decision-making.

> In this project, we use:
- 🧲 **MRI Scans**
- 🔍 **CT Scans**
- 📝 **Patient Textual Data** (medical history, symptoms)

Combining these modalities allows for a **holistic understanding** of brain anomalies.

---

## 🧠💡 Deep Learning (Transfer Learning)

We adopt a **Transfer Learning** approach to fine-tune **pre-trained models** that are proven effective in medical image analysis.

🏗️ Models used:
- 🕸️ **ResNet**
- 🌿 **EfficientNet**
- 📱 **MobileNet**
- 🌐 **DenseNet**

This accelerates training while enhancing performance, particularly on small medical datasets.

---

## 🤝 Model Ensembling

To maximize accuracy and robustness, we use **Model Ensembling** — combining predictions from:
- ResNet
- EfficientNet
- MobileNet
- DenseNet

> Ensemble techniques help reduce overfitting and increase generalization, especially crucial in critical healthcare tasks.

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Tech Stack

The system is designed for **real-time, deployable solutions**. We utilize:

- 🔥 **PyTorch** – for deep learning model training
- 🧠 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – for an intelligent chatbot to answer patient queries
- 🌐 **Flask** – for model API deployment
- 📊 **Sklearn** – for preprocessing and metrics evaluation
- 🧪 **OpenCV** – for image operations
- 📦 **NumPy, Pandas** – for data handling

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Multimodal Input Processing
- ✅ Transfer Learning on Medical Imaging
- ✅ Ensemble of Multiple CNN Architectures
- ✅ Explainable Results (Coming Soon 🔍)
- ✅ Intelligent Patient Query Chatbot via RAG
- ✅ Flask-based Web Deployment
